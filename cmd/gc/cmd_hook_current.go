		Long: `Prints the work bead this session most recently claimed with gc hook --claim.

The claim protocol stamps the claimed bead id onto the calling session's own
bead, because the environment alone cannot reliably name it: $GC_BEAD_ID exists
only in the controller's dispatch condition environment, never in a session
shell, and $GC_TRIGGER_BEAD_ID — exported to demand-spawned pool seats as a
pool-level spawn marker — is absent on other seats (e.g. a warm seat bound
after start) and never decides what a session claims; the pool is pull. Named
singleton sessions can carry a stale $GC_TRIGGER_BEAD_ID for their entire
lifetime, pointing at a different bead than the one currently claimed, so it
must never be consulted ahead of the claim. A formula step that must close
the bead it is running reads the stamp back here:

    BEAD_ID="${GC_BEAD_ID:-$(gc hook current --id-only)}"

The calling session is taken from $GC_SESSION_ID. Exits 1 when there is no
session identity and when the session has claimed nothing, so a caller that
cannot name its bead fails loudly instead of skipping its own work.`,
