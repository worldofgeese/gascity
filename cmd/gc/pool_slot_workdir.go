// slot's own worktree root (.gc/worktrees/<rig>/<slot>) -- a session-slot
// label, not evidence that a bead owns a real per-bead worktree. It matches
// both the city-relative form worktree-per-bead dispatch normally stores
// (see resolveWorkDirAgainstCity) and the equivalent absolute form (legacy
// convention).
//
// Shape alone is not sufficient: per-bead worktrees are SIBLINGS of pool
// slots under .gc/worktrees/<rig>/ (the same layout bead_worktree_reaper.go
// guards with sessionHomes), so .gc/worktrees/gascity/ga-ui3mbs sits at the
// exact depth a slot does. The final segment is therefore checked against the
// city's configured bead prefixes: a name that resolves to a bead ID
// ("ga-ui3mbs", "ga-klo4gz.11-measure") is a per-bead worktree, not a slot,
// while "builder-1" / "builder-feature-branch" have no configured prefix and
// stay slots.
//
// The match is on the LAST FOUR path segments only, so a deeper per-bead path
// nested under a pool slot (.gc/worktrees/<rig>/<slot>/<slug>) or a
// differently-rooted worktree (worktrees/<bead-id>, .claude/worktrees/...)
// correctly does not match. Deeper slot layouts
// (.gc/worktrees/<rig>/<pool>/<slot>) likewise do not match; both the guard
// and the repair are simply inert there, which fails safe.

// value, rather than the executing session's self-reported pool_managed
// status -- closing the gap where a session physically running from a pool
// slot but whose own session bead never carries pool_managed=true could
// otherwise bypass workDirStampHasOwnershipEvidence entirely.
//
// When the canonical key is absent but the legacy key holds real, differing
// evidence, a slot-shaped stamp is refused too: writing it manufactures
// exactly the canonical/legacy disagreement worktreeSpecForBead fails closed
// on, starving the bead instead of leaving it resolvable from legacy alone.
//
// Deliberately asymmetric with poolSlotWorkDirRepairFor on a nil cfg: without
// config, isPoolSlotWorkDirRoot cannot recognize a per-bead name and errs
// toward "is a slot" for every four-segment .gc/worktrees path. That makes
// this guard nil-inert in the INCOMING direction only: a slot-shaped incoming
// value is still refused when the canonical is absent, but an EXISTING
// canonical is misread as a slot too, hits the short-circuit below, and the
// overwrite is PERMITTED -- so a nil cfg does not make this guard uniformly
// conservative. The repair direction cannot tolerate even that, because it
// writes, so poolSlotWorkDirRepairFor additionally refuses to act on a nil
// cfg. Do not "simplify" the two into a shared nil-cfg policy. Neither branch
// is reachable in production: every reconciler call site passes a loaded
// config (city_runtime.go:3409 returns early on a nil filtered config).
